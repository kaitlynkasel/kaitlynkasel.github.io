            <h1>Voice Lessons</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Aaron Baldauf - I was the music director for the last month of Broadway Bound summer camps! I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in Vocal and General Music Education and recently moved to Seattle
                after working as a teacher and accompanist in the Madison area for the past 4 years. I have worked with students of all ages and experience levels in school, choral, and theatrical settings. As a teacher, I believe no two voices are the
                same, and I cater lessons to each student to help them develop their own individual voice, build confidence in their singing, and find what makes their sound unique!
            </p>
