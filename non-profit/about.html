            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Broadway Bound Children’s Theatre transforms the lives of children, ages 5 – 18 through active participation in theatre arts combining a fun and supportive atmosphere with professional standards. Children of all skill levels and backgrounds
                are challenged and supported while developing their mental, physical, emotional, social and creative potential through the joy and discipline of live theatre. We offer a season of full scale productions performed in professional theatres
                in Seattle, enrichment classes in drama, music, and dance, and a wide variety of summer camps. These beginner to advanced educational arts programs are available in the University District. Broadway Bound makes every effort to make classes,
                productions, and performances available to every student who wants to participate.</p>
