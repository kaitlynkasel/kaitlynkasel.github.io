    <!--I challenged myself with this project mostly by incorporating everything I'd learned previously such as buttons, tables, and css into one. For a new project, I tried text shadow and rotate, which weren't that challenging, but were a little tricky to get the internal CSS to work. For a bigger challenge, I did a hover element, which involved multiple divs and css commands. I was very proud of getting that figured out and stretching it to include an image beyond just text. All in all, the hardest part of this project was navigating GIT and teamwork- but in the end we pulled through and made a consistent, complex website!-->
