            <td>An escape room, also known as an escape game, puzzle room or exit game, is a game in which a team of players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal in a limited amount
                of time. The goal is often to escape from the site of the game. Multiple escape rooms are available at the Puzzle Masters Escapes, including Area 51, Book of Secrets, and What Happened in Vegas. Rooms are for 2-8 players and you have 60
                minutes to solve the clues to escape. Details for each room range from suspenseful and intellectual to fast-paced and light-hearted. for more information you can watch video down below and see one of their customer's adventure in escape

            <td> <br>King County is packed with great parks to explore and give kids some room for risky play. The playground can be a wonderful place for kids to run, swing and jump but don’t go to the same park you usually frequent! Mix it up and find new
                places for outside fun and family entertainment.The City of Kirkland boasts an extraordinary parks system, thanks to long-ago City leaders who had the foresight to plan for parklands along the shores of Lake Washington, thus preserving
                the space for future generations. It is also thanks to the Kirkland community members of today, whose love for preservation and advocacy for parks has resulted in the City’s ability to not only care for its parks, but consistently enhance
                and improve them. As a result, Kirkland residents, neighbors and guests can enjoy Kirkland’s diverse waterfront landscape, explore wooded forestlands and experience intimate pockets of creek-side old-growth trees located neatly adjacent
                to homes and schools.</td>
