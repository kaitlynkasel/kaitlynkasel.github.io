        <h2>My Self-Care Hobby:Walks</h2>
        <h4>I have never been very connected to nature in terms of going on long hikes or playing outdoor sports, but recently I have been making the effort to take walks for 10-30 minutes every day. It is a pefect break for when I need to stop doing homework
            for a while and it keeps me off of a screen. I like to listen to music suring this time and explore diffrent parts of my neighborhood I havent before. Downtown kirkland is waking distance from my house and I make an effort to walk there, instead
            of driving, when I can.</h4>
